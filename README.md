# Book-Searching-App

I needed a book searching app using google book api. When you open the app you are faced with a blank page with the title and option to search and option to signup/login. When you type in a title or type of book you're looking for and press submit, you're brought to the results page with the list of potential books. You can click on the image and it will take you to the book link to purchase on google. When you signup and login you have the option to save delete and mange books you want to keep a list of.
